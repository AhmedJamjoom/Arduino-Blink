# 🔴🟢🔵 Arduino-Blink

## 📌 Overview  
This beginner-friendly project demonstrates how to **control three individual LEDs** using **three push buttons** with an Arduino.  
Each button toggles the state of one corresponding LED — **Red**, **Green**, or **Blue** — independently.

This project helps you learn:

- 🟢 Digital input (buttons)  
- 🔴 Digital output (LEDs)  
- 🔵 Basic Arduino code structure

## 🎯 Project Goal  
Control **3 LEDs (Red, Green, Blue)** using **3 push buttons**.  
Each button toggles its assigned LED **ON** or **OFF** independently.
